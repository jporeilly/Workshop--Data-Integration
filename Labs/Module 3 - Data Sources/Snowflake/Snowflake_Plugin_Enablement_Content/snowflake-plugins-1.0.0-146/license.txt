Subject to Sections 5 and 11 and the exceptions in this Section, if a third party makes a claim against You that the Software infringes that party's patent rights or copyright ("IP Claim"), HITACHI will provide the following recourse (which, to the extent permitted by applicable law, comprises Your sole and exclusive remedy against HITACHI and HITACHI's sole and exclusive liability to You for the IP Claim):
   (a)  HITACHI will defend or settle the IP Claim at our option and cost, and pay to You the amount of damages, losses and costs finally awarded against You or settled by You (with HITACHI's written consent), provided that You

      (iii) replace it with something that has similar functionality to the Software. If HITACHI considers that none of these options are reasonably possible, HITACHI will provide You with a refund, provided that You promptly return the Software to HITACHI.

HITACHI will not be liable to provide any remedies in this Section with respect to
   (a)  any Third Party Software that is not included on HITACHI's standard price list at the time of the IP Claim;
   (b)  any Third Party Related OSS or

      (ii)  used outside the stated standard operating environment for the Software or for an unauthorized purpose or
      (iii) failed to use a more recent version of the Software that was available to You and would have avoided the infringement or where the IP Claim arises due to any material or item that You own or have sourced from a third party Yourself.

13.  LIABILITY LIMITATIONS

Each Party must keep any Confidential Information that is disclosed by the other party as confidential by using the same degree of care used to protect our own Confidential Information.  Each Party must not disclose the other Party's Confidential Information to any third party, without the other Party's prior written consent.

That Party will provide follow-up, written notice as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than fifteen (15) days after discovery.  The written notice will include, to the extent the information is currently available:

If HITACHI fails to perform, or delays in the performance of, any service or other obligation required of HITACHI under these License Terms, HITACHI will not be liable to You for the failure or non-performance, to the extent that such failure or non-performance is caused by Your act or omission, or the act or omission of Your Personnel or any other person acting on Your behalf. In any event, You agree to take all steps and measures available to You in order to mitigate and minimize the losses, costs and damages arising from such failure or non-performance, irrespective of the nature and extent of Your contribution.

17.  Export Compliance and Anti-Bribery.
You acknowledge that in various countries, laws and regulations regulate the export of computer products and technology which may prohibit use, sale or re-export of such products or technology if You know or have reason to know that such products and technology are for use in connection with the design, development, production, stock piling or use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or missiles and in some countries (e.g. China) for certain conventional military end-uses.  If You sell or transfer to another person or entity title in or right to use any Software, you will ensure that all applicable export restrictions of the nature described in this section are observed. Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and not engage in any activity, practice or conduct that would constitute an offence under such laws and regulations. You must read, understand and comply with the HITACHI Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.

18.  Termination of License
Your license in the Software will terminate:
   (i)   when that Software is replaced with any upgrade, revision or replacement Software;
   (ii)  when the License Term or subscription period ends, if any is expressly stated; or
   (iii) if You are in breach of any of these License Terms or any license for Third Party Software.

19.  Dispute Resolution.
Both Parties will use reasonable efforts to get an appropriate person from our respective management teams to meet and attempt to resolve any dispute regarding these License Terms in good faith.  If such management are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days, the Parties may resort to alternate dispute resolution such as arbitration (if both Parties agree) or otherwise a Party may seek recourse from the courts.  Either party may seek injunctive or other urgent equitable relief at any time.

20.  Governing Law.
These License Terms will be governed by California law, with venue and exclusive jurisdiction in the appropriate courts in Santa Clara County, California.  To the extent allowed, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International sale of goods and its implementing legislation will not apply to these License Terms.

21.  Miscellaneous.
Neither Party will be responsible for any failure to meet any of our obligations (except payment obligations) due to matters beyond our reasonable control provided reasonable efforts have been made to perform them.  You must not assign, or otherwise transfer any of Your rights under these License Terms without HITACHI's prior written agreement.  Notices made under these License Terms must be in writing to a senior executive. Notices will be deemed given: where they are hand delivered, when a duly authorized employee or representative of the recipient gives written acknowledgement of receipt; for email communication, at the time the communication enters into the information system of the recipient; for posting, three days after dispatch and for fax, on receipted transmission of the fax. Rights and obligations under these License Terms, which by their nature should survive the termination or expiry, will remain in effect after termination.  If either of us fails to promptly exercise any contractual right, this does not of itself mean that the right has been waived.  For a waiver of a right to be valid, it must be written and it will not give rise to an ongoing waiver or any expectation that the right will not be enforced, unless it is expressly stated to do so.  These Terms may not be modified except in writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. There are no third-party beneficiaries to these License Terms.  All oral or written communications, understandings, proposals, representations and warranties are by agreement, excluded and are of no force or effect (to the extent permitted at law).  These License Terms (and all related Quotes, Orders and Order Confirmations that comprise a transaction to which these License Terms apply) are the entire agreement relating to their subject matter.  You grant to HITACHI the limited right to use Your company and brand name and/or logo in promotional materials, including press releases, presentations and customer references regarding the sale of Software. These permissions are free of charge and for worldwide use in any medium. The foregoing notwithstanding, HITACHI agrees to obtain Your prior written approval for publicity that contains claims, quotes, endorsements or attributions by You, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Rights and obligations under these License Terms, which by their nature should survive the termination or expiration, will remain in effect after termination.
