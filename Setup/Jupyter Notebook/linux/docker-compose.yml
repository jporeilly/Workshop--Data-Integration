# =============================================================================
# DOCKER COMPOSE - Jupyter Lab Container (Linux)
# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   Defines a single-service Docker deployment that runs Jupyter Lab with the
#   SciPy scientific-computing stack. Host directories under ~/Jupyter-Notebook
#   are bind-mounted into the container so that files created by Pentaho Data
#   Integration (PDI) on the host are immediately visible inside the notebook
#   environment, and vice-versa.
#
# Image:
#   jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest
#     - Based on the official Jupyter Docker Stacks project
#     - Includes Python 3, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn,
#       SciPy, and many other scientific packages pre-installed
#     - https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/
#
# Ports:
#   8888  ->  Jupyter Lab web interface (http://localhost:8888)
#
# Authentication:
#   Token: datascience   (set via JUPYTER_TOKEN environment variable)
#
# Volume mappings (Host -> Container):
#   ~/Jupyter-Notebook/datasets      -> /home/jovyan/datasets    (source CSV data)
#   ~/Jupyter-Notebook/notebooks     -> /home/jovyan/notebooks   (notebook files)
#   ~/Jupyter-Notebook/pdi-output    -> /home/jovyan/pdi-output  (PDI output landing zone)
#   ~/Jupyter-Notebook/reports       -> /home/jovyan/reports     (generated reports)
#   ~/Jupyter-Notebook/workshop-data -> /home/jovyan/work        (general workspace)
#
# Health check:
#   Polls http://localhost:8888/lab every 30 seconds to confirm the service
#   is responsive. The container is marked unhealthy after 3 consecutive
#   failures, which can be used by orchestrators to trigger a restart.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose up -d          # Start in detached mode
#   docker compose ps             # Check status
#   docker compose logs           # View logs
#   docker compose down           # Stop and remove container
#
# Notes:
#   - "user: root" is required so the container process can read/write the
#     bind-mounted host directories regardless of the host UID/GID.
#   - The "unless-stopped" restart policy ensures the container comes back
#     automatically after a host reboot or Docker daemon restart.
#   - The ~/  (tilde) paths are expanded by Docker Compose on Linux to the
#     current user's home directory.

services:
  jupyter:
    # --- Container image -----------------------------------------------------
    # jupyter/scipy-notebook includes the full SciPy scientific stack:
    # Python 3, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.
    image: jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest

    # --- Container name ------------------------------------------------------
    # Fixed name makes it easy to reference in docker exec / docker logs.
    container_name: jupyter-datascience

    # --- Restart policy ------------------------------------------------------
    # "unless-stopped" keeps the container running across Docker restarts
    # and host reboots, but respects a manual "docker compose down".
    restart: unless-stopped

    # --- Port mappings -------------------------------------------------------
    # Map host port 8888 to container port 8888 (Jupyter Lab web UI).
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"

    # --- Environment variables -----------------------------------------------
    environment:
      # Enable the Jupyter Lab interface (instead of classic notebook)
      - JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes
      # Set the authentication token required to log in
      - JUPYTER_TOKEN=datascience
      # Set the container timezone (adjust to your locale if needed)
      - TZ=Europe/London

    # --- Bind-mount volumes --------------------------------------------------
    # Each host directory is mapped to a corresponding path inside the
    # container. Files written by PDI on the host (e.g. pdi-output/) appear
    # instantly in the notebook, and reports generated inside the notebook
    # (e.g. reports/) are visible on the host.
    volumes:
      # datasets/ : Source CSV files (sales_data.csv, orders.csv, etc.)
      - type: bind
        source: ~/Jupyter-Notebook/datasets
        target: /home/jovyan/datasets
      # notebooks/ : Jupyter .ipynb files (sales_analysis.ipynb, welcome.ipynb)
      - type: bind
        source: ~/Jupyter-Notebook/notebooks
        target: /home/jovyan/notebooks
      # pdi-output/ : Landing zone where PDI transformations write output CSV files.
      #               The file_watcher.py monitors this folder for new files.
      - type: bind
        source: ~/Jupyter-Notebook/pdi-output
        target: /home/jovyan/pdi-output
      # reports/ : Analysis output (Excel/CSV reports generated by notebooks)
      - type: bind
        source: ~/Jupyter-Notebook/reports
        target: /home/jovyan/reports
      # workshop-data/ : General-purpose workspace directory
      - type: bind
        source: ~/Jupyter-Notebook/workshop-data
        target: /home/jovyan/work
      # scripts/post-start.sh : Startup script that installs Python packages
      #                         (watchdog, xlsxwriter) before launching Jupyter Lab.
      - type: bind
        source: ~/Jupyter-Notebook/scripts/post-start.sh
        target: /usr/local/bin/post-start.sh

    # --- Startup command -----------------------------------------------------
    # Runs the post-start.sh script which installs required Python packages
    # (watchdog, xlsxwriter) and then launches Jupyter Lab. This eliminates
    # the need for manual "docker exec pip install" after container recreates.
    command: bash /usr/local/bin/post-start.sh

    # --- Run as root ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Required to ensure the container process can read/write bind-mounted
    # host directories regardless of file ownership on the host.
    user: root

    # --- Health check --------------------------------------------------------
    # Docker periodically curls the Jupyter Lab endpoint to verify the
    # service is responsive. If 3 consecutive checks fail, the container
    # is marked "unhealthy".
    #   interval     : Time between checks (30 seconds)
    #   timeout      : Max wait per check (10 seconds)
    #   retries      : Failures before marking unhealthy (3)
    #   start_period : Grace period after container start before checks begin (60s)
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8888/lab"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 60s
